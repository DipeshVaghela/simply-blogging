To run this project locally on computer do the following below steps :

Here, there are mainly two roles

1. Admin
1) Can add and delete articals and news-letters
2) Admin username : **dipeshvaghela**  
3) Admin password : **Admin@5898**

2. Customer
1) Can only read the articals and news-letters

I have managed localstorage for storing admin-login-credential
so only one time it will ask for verification
